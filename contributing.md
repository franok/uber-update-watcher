# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome!

## Bug Reporting

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead contact me directly.
* File a GitHub issue for any other type of bug with a prefix `[bug]` and choose a proper title.
    * Provide a detailed description:
        * expected behavior vs. actual behaviour
        * append logs
    * Use markdown to format your text (highlight code and logs using backticks)
    * If you have a solution in mind, great! Let me know! You are also welcome to open a Pull Request, after you filed the issue.

## Feature Requests

* File a GitHub issue with prefix `[freature-request]` and choose a proper title.
* Provide a detailed description.
* Let's discuss your suggestion. If we find it's a good idea, you can open a Pull Request.

## Pull Requests

See above. For bugs or feature requests, file a GitHub issue (except for security vulnerabilities).

## Questions

File a GitHub issue with the prefix `[question]`.

## Misc

Note that this is a side-project, which I started in my free-time and just made it available under an open source license.
For existing [issues])(https://github.com/franok/uber-update-watcher/issues) feel free to create a Pull Request.
I'll come back to you, if I find the time.

Be kind to each other!
